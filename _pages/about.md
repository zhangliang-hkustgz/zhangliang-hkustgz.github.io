I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the FinTech Thrust, HKUST (GZ). Currently, I am an Associate Research Fellow at HEC Paris, France, working with <a href="https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/LI-Xitong"> Prof. Xitong Li </a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/yong-tan/"> Prof. Yong Tan </a> from University of Washington and <a href="https://semen.buaa.edu.cn/Faculty/Information_Systems/WU_Junjie/Profile.htm"> Prof. Junjie Wu </a> from Beihang University. I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/"> Prof. Cheng Long </a>. My research focuses on data mining, graph neural networks, large language models, and applied AI, with an emphasis on developing effective machine learning methods to solve practical business and society problems.
